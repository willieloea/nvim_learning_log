# My log of learning Neovim
## Introduction - What is this and why is this:
This is a log of me learing to customize and use Neovim after using Vim as my primary coding and note taking editor for 6 months as of the writing of this entry (2024/03/06). I am doing this in an attempt to create a document that is useful to me or to someone else in the future. I am switching to Neovim because I ran into frustrations when I tried to customize Vim.
